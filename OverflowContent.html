    <ul>
        <li>hidden
            This property simply hides any
            extra content that does not fit in
            the box.</li>
        <li>
            Scroll This property adds a scrollbar to
            the box so that users can scroll
            to see the missing content.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ashish Chaurasiya</h2>
    <p class="one">The overflow property tells the
        browser what to do if the content
        contained within a box is larger
        than the box itself. It can have
        one of two values:</p>
    <h2>Abhishek</h2>
    <p class="two">
        The overflow property is
        particularly handy because some
        browsers allow users to adjust
        the size of the text to appear as
        large or as small as they want. If
        the text is set too large then the
        page can become an unreadable
        mess. Hiding the overflow on
        such boxes helps prevent items
        overlapping on the page.

        The border-width property
        is used to control the width
        of a border. The value of this
        property can either be given
        in pixels or using one of the
        following values:
        thin
        medium
        thick
    </p>
