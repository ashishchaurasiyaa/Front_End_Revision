      Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is
      key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align
      items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS Box
      Model. You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology
      that relates to it.
    </h1>
    <p class="box_alternate">
        <ul>
            <li>The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
            <li>The width and height properties will not apply.</li>
            <li>Top and bottom padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.</li>
            <li>Left and right padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.</li>
            <li>Some HTML elements, such as a, span, em and strong use inline as their outer display type by default.</li>
            <li>A list, which is laid out using display: flex. This establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.</li>
        </ul>
