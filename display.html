        <p>Pratap Singh I, popularly known as Maharana Pratap (c. 9 May 1540 â€“ 19 January 1597), was a Hindu Rajput king
            of Mewar from the Sisodia dynasty. He fought several major battles against Akbar including the Battle of
            Haldighati in 1576 to resist the expansionist policy of the Mughal empire. Pratap became a folk hero for his
            military resistance through guerrilla warfare which proved inspirational for later rebels against Mughals.
            "Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states,
            constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana
            Pratap's methods of guerrilla warfare was later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and
            by Emperor Shivaji"
